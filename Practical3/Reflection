briefly note your thoughts about the Practical:
GitKraken is cute but a bit confusing.

Did everything go well? 
Most of the things goes well XD.

Are there things that were challenging?
Yes, figure out what I have done and correct the wrong steps when I do not know much about how the Kraken work is challenging.

What questions do you have? 
A lot, I hope I'll recall all of them...
1. The instruction said that The commit messages should be relatively informative. Since this tip is on the last page and I didn't read it until I finish all my work, a lot of commit messages of mine didn't make sense (But that's usually because I was really confusing by the diff steps so I typed WHAAAT, something like that). Is it possible to change the commit information afterwards? And how?
2. I don't know what the "index" file is for when we're creating a website. Why should it be deleted so that the webpage can be shown?
3. What does ".DS_Store" in my modification means? Is it because every time I move one file to another folder (or maybe open a folder) may create a ".DS_Store" modification?
4. I don't know how to access an overall view of my files in GitKraken. I just went back to the changes I make to find them, or look for them in the finder.
5. Is moving a repository a permanent loss of data?

If you read these, thank you for checking on my reflection ☺️!
