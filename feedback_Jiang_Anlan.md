# This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [√] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:

The code for week 3 is great. There is no need to change anything.

### Feedback Week 4:

- [√] be more precise when saying what the mystery code does.


- [√] In the "powers of 2" file, there is not a lot of pseudocode that explains what you did

- [√] Also, in the "powers of 2" file, there are two conflicting solutions, one which works and one which does not. The final file should have only the correct solution, don't rely on your user to know which is which.

### Feedback Week 5:


- [ ] The code for counting nucleotides and displaying the results is fine, but you should ask the user to input a nucleotide sequence, instead of hard-coding it in the script.

- [ ] The code for reverse ordering words and sorting them is fine, but you should ask the user to input the string. Look up the input() function for more information

This asssesment is formative and does not form part of your final grade. 

If this was a summative assessment, you would have scored 85 out of 100
